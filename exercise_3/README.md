### Project: Switches

Being able to read the input from a button or switch lets us make our projects interactive.

#### Some challenges

Try your hand at the following projects. If you get stuck, you can take a look at the code samples above.

1. When you press the button, the LED blinks.  (Solution: switch-read.ino)
2. Count the number of times the button has been pressed, and output the results to the serial console.  (Solution: button-count.ino)
3. Hook up a green LED on the breadboard. Have a button press alternate between turning the green LED and the onboard LED on.  (Solution: switch-toggle.ino)
4. Make the LED blink until the user presses the button 4 times within 1 second.  (Solution: blink-until.ino)
