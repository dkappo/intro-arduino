### Project: Switches

Being able to read the input from a button or switch lets us make our projects interactive.

#### Some challenges

1. When you press the button, the LED blinks.  (Solution: switch-read.ino)
2. Count the number of times the button has been pressed, and output the results to the serial console.  (Solution: button-count.ino)
3. Hook up a green LED on the breadboard. Have a button press alternate between turning the green LED and the onboard LED on.  (Solution: switch-toggle.ino)
