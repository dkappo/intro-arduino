### Adding components

Connecting the Arduino to external components allows it to interact with the rest of the world.

If you connect the LED on your breadboard to pin 13 on the Arduino, you can use the code from exercise 1 to test it.

#### Extra challenge

Try to connect 2 LEDs to your Arduino, and get them to turn on and off alternately from each other (ie. when one is on, the other is off). If you're not sure what to do, you can check the sample code above.
