### Using sensors

Reading data from sensors (like the temperature sensors we're using today) allows us to make projects that do things automatically for us based on external conditions.

#### Challenges
1. Read the voltage from the temperature sensor and display it on the serial console.  (Solution: read-analog-voltage.ino)
2. Translate the voltage into a temperature and display it on the serial console.  (Solution: display-temperature.ino)
3. Light up the red LED if the temperature is above 27C, light up the green LED if the temperature is below 27C. (Solution: temperature-high-low.ino)
4. Light up the red LED if the temperature is rising, light up the green LED if the temperature is falling.  (Solution: temperature-rising-falling.ino)
