### Extra challenges for exercise 1

Try the challenges without looking at the code above first. If you can't get it to work the way you expect, you can check the above files for an example of how it could look.

1. Make the LED blink twice as fast as the blink.ino program.  (Solution: blinkfaster.ino)
2. Make the LED blink the distress signal SOS.  (Solution: SOS-basic.ino and SOS-improved.ino)
3. Think of ways in which blinking the LED faster/slower could be used to dim the light.  (Solution: LED-dim.ino)
